# About Me:
Hello, I am Gregory Hisel, a junior as a General Physics Major at the University of Connecticut. I am very interested in pursuing health physics as my long-term career as my dad has pursued the field for a very long time and I have an idea of the career path already. I hope pursuing this job can expand my career and perhaps open up more possiblilities of careers I have yet to think about.
