# Initial Post

This is my first of many posts as I hope to increase my total experience at the University of Connecticut as I join more clubs and take more classes. I hope to expand my experiences to grow not just my career, but to grow my character as a whole. 

# Fun Facts About Me:
I like solving puzzles such as rubik's cubes. I have solved the standard 3x3x3, the 2x2x2, a 3x2x2, a rubik's pyramix, a megaminx, and the ivy cube.

Another fun fact is that prior to becoming a physics major at the University of Connecticut, I was considering to be a statistics major and was a computer science major.
